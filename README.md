CLI Wallet

The motive behind my wallet project is to be open and understandable to every user. I strive to create a space where every transaction and action is transparent and accessible, without unnecessary analytics and confusing explanations. my wallet is designed to serve as an example of cleanliness and clarity, where every user can easily understand and control their finances.
